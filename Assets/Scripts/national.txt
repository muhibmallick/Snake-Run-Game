so basically there are 2 situations

first situation is:
private float startTime;
private float journeyTime=4.0f;
private void Start()
{
    startTime=Time.time;
}

private void Update()
{
    float fractionTime=(Time.time-startTime)/journeyTime;

    Vector3.Slerp(startPosition,endPosition,fractionTime);
}


second situation is:


private float elapsedTime=0f;
private float desiredDuration=4.0f;

private void Update()
{
    elapsedTime+=Time.deltaTime;
    float percentage = elapsedTime/desiredDuration;
    Vector3.Slerp(startPosition,endPosition,percentage);
}



both technques are samne right??





interpolation is basically this:


take 2 points in a world space suppose they are A and B, and you have an object that is C;
interpolation means you want to move C from A to B in a linear direction, no circular path, just linear.

it returns a float value, so for example if C is in the middle of A and B, the interlolation will return 0.5.
I think you're smart enough to understand everything else.
